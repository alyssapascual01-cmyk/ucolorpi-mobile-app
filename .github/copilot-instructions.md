# Copilot / AI Assistant Instructions

This repo is a Flutter UI prototype (mock data). The primary goal for changes is UI, navigation, and small feature work — not full backend engineering. Be conservative: follow existing patterns and avoid introducing large architectural shifts unless requested.

- **Project entry point & Firebase**: The app starts at `lib/main.dart`. It initializes Firebase via `firebase_options.dart` and then shows `SignInScreen`.
  - Example: `await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);`
  - Firebase platform options were generated by the FlutterFire tooling. If you must change Firebase settings, regenerate `firebase_options.dart` with the FlutterFire CLI rather than hand-editing it.

- **Auth surface**: `lib/auth.dart` is the thin wrapper used for authentication (uses `firebase_auth`). Reuse this class for sign-in/sign-up flows and do not duplicate FirebaseAuth logic across screens.

- **UI / data intent**: README states this is a UI prototype using mock data. Many screens consume `mockData.dart` (e.g. `homepage.dart`, `recordHistory.dart`, `A_NewScan.dart`). When adding UI features prefer extending mock data until the team asks for backend integration.

- **File and naming conventions to note**:
  - Screens and widgets are implemented in `lib/` using a mix of snake_case and CamelCase filenames (examples: `signin_screen.dart`, `homepage.dart`, `A_NewScan.dart`). Follow the existing filename spelling/casing exactly because imports are literal on some platforms.
  - State is mostly local (StatefulWidgets) and small helper classes (`Auth`). No global state-management package (Provider/Bloc) is used — prefer the same style for small changes.

- **Key files & where to look**:
  - App entry and theme: `lib/main.dart`
  - Auth wrapper: `lib/auth.dart`
  - Screens: `lib/signin_screen.dart`, `lib/signup_screen.dart`, `lib/homepage.dart`, `lib/recordHistory.dart`, `lib/A_NewScan.dart`, `lib/B_NewScan.dart`
  - Mock data: `lib/mockData.dart`
  - Firebase options: `lib/firebase_options.dart`
  - Android Firebase config: `android/app/google-services.json` (present)
  - Assets: `assets/images/ucolorpi_icon.svg` (used via `flutter_svg`)

- **Dependencies & build**:
  - See `pubspec.yaml` for dependencies used (`firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `google_fonts`, `flutter_svg`). Add new packages via `flutter pub add <package>` and run `flutter pub get`.
  - Common developer commands:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run            # runs on default connected device
flutter run -d windows # run desktop windows target
flutter test           # run unit/widget tests
flutter build apk      # build Android APK
```

- **Platform & build cautions**:
  - Android Gradle files use Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`). Keep changes syntax-correct for Kotlin DSL.
  - If you change Firebase configuration, prefer the FlutterFire CLI to keep `firebase_options.dart` and platform files (google-services.json / plist) in sync.

- **Patterns & examples to re-use**:
  - Navigation: code commonly uses `Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(...))` for screen transitions — follow that approach for small flows.
  - Device/simulated flows: `homepage.dart` simulates device connection with local state and `Future.delayed(...)`. For prototypes, keep simulation logic similar to maintain UI parity.
  - Styles: App-wide font set via `google_fonts` in `MyApp` (Poppins). Reuse the same theming approach when adding text styles.

- **Tests & CI**:
  - There is a single `test/widget_test.dart`. There is no CI config in the repo. Run `flutter test` locally.

- **Avoid**:
  - Do not introduce a backend integration or alter persistent storage without an explicit task — this repo is a UI prototype.
  - Avoid renaming or moving files with unusual casing (e.g. `A_NewScan.dart`) — changing names can break imports on CI or other developers' platforms.

If anything in these notes is unclear or you want me to expand examples (e.g., show how to regenerate `firebase_options.dart`, or standardize filenames), tell me which section to expand and I will update this file.
